## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Use case
: You have different classes that create objects that do the same kind of work (e.g. Logistic company has trucks, ships, planes that all transport goods).
Explanation: [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

What it does for you
: Create objects and methods without having to specify the class or name of method (This is handled by factory object).

## Using R

1. Use R in console
: ```bash
R
```

2. **Type your code**


3. Quit R in console
: ```bash
q()
```

Get help with functions and features
: ```R
?functionName
```

Find functions and features matching a term of interest
: ```R
??TermOfInterest
``` 

Execute R-script from terminal
: ```bash
Rscript myScript.R
```

## Import, Input, Output

Importing other scripts
: ```R
source("otherScript.R")
``` 
Executes the contents of the script.

Send all standard output to a file
: ```R
sink("output.txt")
```

Print to standard output
: ```R
print("my Output")
```

## Operations, numbers, vectors

Assign values to a variable
: ```R
x <- 4.5
```

Create a vector
: ```R
x <- c(10, 4.5, 12, 5)
```
**!**: If you integrate vectors in your vector ( `c(10, c(11, 12), 13)` ) it will get flattened (like `c(10, 11, 12, 13)` ).

Elementwise adding, subtracting, deviding, multiplying, ... vectors
: ```R
x <- c(1, 2)
y <- c(10, 11, 12, 13)
z <- x + y
```
::: {.callout-warning}
You can make elementwise operations with vectors of different lengths, as long as the longer one is a multiple of the shorter one. **The shorter vector is repeated**. :anguished:
